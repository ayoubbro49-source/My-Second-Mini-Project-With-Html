# 🏆 My First HTML Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my first official web project! This is a personal portfolio page where I showcase my journey, skills, and interests using pure HTML.

## 🚀 About This Project
This project was built to practice and master the fundamentals of web structure. I focused on using semantic HTML tags and organizing content effectively.

### 🛠 Tech Stack Used:
* **HTML5**: Used for the structure and content.
* **Forms & Tables**: To display personal data and skill comparisons.
* **Multimedia**: Integration of images, audio, and video elements.
* **Character Entities**: Used various icons and symbols to enhance the UI.

## 👤 About Me
I'm **Ayoub**, a 20-year-old aspiring **Front-End Developer** from Morocco. Currently, I'm a university student who decided to shift focus toward mastering the art of coding.

## 🔑 Key Features in this Code:
- ✅ **Clean Structure**: Organized using headings (`h1`-`h5`) and `div` tags.
- ✅ **Skills Table**: A comparison of my strengths (like English and Coding).
- ✅ **Media Gallery**: Showcasing my favorite movies, cars, and bikes.
- ✅ **Certificates**: Displaying my official HTML and English certifications.

## 📈 My Learning Journey
"Continuity is my strength." Even though I started from scratch, I'm putting in the work every day. My back might hurt from sitting, but the results are worth it! 💻🔥
